2nd Deployment with GitHub, Jenkins, Maven and Docker

SETUP OF DOCKER ENVIRONMENT
-Setup Linux EC2 instance(Amazon Linux 2, t2.micro,SG,KP,tag-aside from that leave everything as is)
-Install docker(yum install docker -y)
-Start docker services
-Understand basic docker commands(docker images, docker ps, docker ps -a etc)

CREATING A DOCKER CONTAINER
To create a docker container, a docker image is required. After creating the docker image,
simply use the docker run command.
How to obtain a docker image? Two ways:
1-From dockerhub, using docker pull command to take image onto our local system
2-Creating our own dockerfile, which contains instructions for how your docker container should be constructed
Use docker build command to create a docker image out of a Dockerfile

-Writing 1st Dockerfile:
FROM: to pull the base image
RUN: To execute commands
CMD: To provide defaults for an executing container
ENTYPOINT: To configure a container that will run as an executable
WORKDIR: Sets the working directory
COPY: To copy a directory from local machine to the docker container
ADD: copies files and folders from your local machine to docker containers
EXPOSE: Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime
ENV: Sets environment variables

Dockerfile instructions
-Install tomcat on centos
-Pull centos from docker hub-FROM
-Install java-RUN
-Create /opt/tomcat directory-RUN
-Change work directory to /opt/tomcat-WORKDIR
-Download tomcat packages-ADD/RUN
-Extract tar.gz file-RUN
-Rename to tomcat directory-RUN
-Tell to docker that it runs on port 8080-EXPOSE
-Start tomcat services-CMD

encountered following issue when Dockerfile was executed: 
Failed to download metadata for repo 'appstream': Cannot prepare internal mirrorlist: No URLs in mirrorlist
FIXED ERROR BY REFERRING TO STACK OVERFLOW AND INPUTTING THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS BEOFRE yum install java -y
RUN cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
RUN sed -i 's/mirrorlist/#mirrorlist/g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*
RUN sed -i 's|#baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org|baseurl=http://vault.centos.org|g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*

- Create an image and container on docker host

- Integrate docker host with Jenkins

- Create CI/CD job on Jenkins to build and deploy on a container

1. Commit code onto GitHub 
2. jenkins pulls the code 
3. Then jenkins enables Maven to build the code into an artifact
4. Then that artifact will be deployed on a Docker container
