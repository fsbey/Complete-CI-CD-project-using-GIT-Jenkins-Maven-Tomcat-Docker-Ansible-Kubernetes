INTEGRATE TOMCAT WITH JENKINS
-Install deploy to container plugin
-Configure tomcat server with credentials
THEN BUILD CODE ON JENKINS WITH THE HELP OF MAVEN AND DEPLOY IT ON TOMCAT SERVER
-Configure local git on jenkins server so that you can make changes to the code locally 
-Enable Poll SCM such that anytime you make a local change and commit that publicly it automatically triggers a new jenkins build
