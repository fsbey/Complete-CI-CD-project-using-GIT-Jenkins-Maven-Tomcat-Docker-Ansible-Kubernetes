CI/CD with GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, Ansible and Docker

We will use Ansible as a deployment tool to relieve Jenkins of the administrative responsibility of deploying,
Jenkins is more effective as a build tool.
Jenkins will take the code from Github and build artifacts aand copy those artifacts onto an 
Ansible server. 
It is then Ansible's responsibility to create images from these artifacts and then deploy containers.
Ansible will take the artifacts and with the help of a Dockerfile, it will create a docker image. 

STEPS
SETUP ANSIBLE SERVER
-Setup EC2 instance

-Setup hostname

-Create ansadmin user

-Add user to sudoers files so ansadmin user can get sudo privileges

-Generate ssh keys

-Enable password based login

-Install Ansible


Integrate Docker host with Ansible 
-On dockerhost 
-create ansadmin
-Add ansadmin to sudoers file 
-Enable password based login

On Ansible Server
-Add to hosts file
-Copy ssh keys
-Test the connection

- Ansible playbook to create image

- Ansible playbook to create container

- Integrate Ansible with Jenkins

-CI/CD job to build code on ansible and deploy it on docker container

1. Commit code onto GitHub 
2. jenkins and maven pulls and builds the code 
3. Unlike the 2nd deployment, Ansible will create the artifacts instead of Maven
4. Ansible will use the artifacts to create and push an image to dockerhub
5. Following ansible commands, Docker host will then be instructed to pull the image from docker hub and deploy a container.
