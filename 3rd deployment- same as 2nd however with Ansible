-CI/CD job to build code on ansible and deploy it on docker container

1. Commit code onto GitHub 
2. jenkins and maven pulls and builds the code 
3. Unlike the 2nd deployment, Ansible will create the artifacts instead of Maven
4. Ansible will use the artifacts to create and push an image to dockerhub
5. Following ansible commands, Docker host will then be instructed to pull the image from docker hub and deploy a container.
